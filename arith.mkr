# Arithmetic library
# This library uses Church numerals to represent natural numbers
# Succesor of a natural number is defined with 0
succ = \n.\f.\x.f (n f x)
0 = \f.\x.x
1 = succ 0
2 = succ 1
3 = succ 2
4 = succ 3
5 = succ 4

# Basic operations on natural numbers
plus = \m.\n.\f.\x.m f (n f x)
mult = \m.\n.\f.m (n f)
